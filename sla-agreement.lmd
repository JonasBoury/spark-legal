    - Discounts, premiums, or revised fees may be agreed if additional customers join the Platform.
    - Fees for extensions beyond Year 1 and for tokenization functionality will be mutually agreed in writing.
- Taxes: Fees are exclusive of VAT and applicable taxes.

### 7. Changes and roadmap

### 9. Service credits

- If monthly uptime falls below 99.5% and the shortfall is attributable to Provider, Customer may request a credit equal to 5% of the monthly-equivalent fee for each 0.5% below target, capped at 25% for that month. Credits are applied against future invoices and are Customer's sole remedy for availability issues.
